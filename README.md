### About Me 
Hello! I am a dedicated pre-medical student with a strong academic background and a passion for patient-centered care, developed through extensive shadowing experiences in various clinical settings.
I’ve had the opportunity to shadow physicians in internal medicine, pediatrics, and emergency care, where I observed clinical workflows, patient interactions, and the application of evidence-based medicine. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the medical field and strengthened my skills in empathy, adaptability, and critical thinking.
In addition to my clinical exposure, I bring technical skills in Microsoft Excel, Python programming, and Microsoft Access, which I’ve applied in academic and research settings to analyze data and manage health-related information. I am also comfortable navigating electronic medical records and observing procedural techniques while upholding confidentiality.
My strong work ethic, commitment to compassionate care, and curiosity about the intersection of medicine and technology position me as a future asset to the healthcare field. In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering at local clinics and exploring public health initiatives.
